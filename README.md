Examples of different machine learning regression models

## This repository contains example implementations of some common regression models:
+ Simple Linear Regression
+ Multiple Linear Regression
+ Polynomial Regression
+ Suport Vector for Regression (SVR)
+ Decision Tree Classification
+ Random Forest Classification

These models are suitable for determining real values in *prediction* scenarios, where we could be forecasting a future value in a time series, or trying to prdict an unknown value based on some observations.
